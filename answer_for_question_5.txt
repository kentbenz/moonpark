Task 5:

MoonPark has made the price calculation engine open available to everyone. This is proving very popular, and several third-party services take it quickly in use.
Unfortunately, it turns out that some clients for various reasons makes extremely many queries, which at times leads to a service overload.
Propose a strategy to solve this problem. Give reasons for your answer.

Answer:
I think we solve this problem on 2 sides:
1. In my system:
- Provide authentication to user who use us services
- Use cache for queries with same parameters
- Increment the memory and CPU for server which contains us services

2. Out my system:
- Provide many kinds service package. Examples:
   + Basic: Allow maximum 1000 queries to us server per day
   + Advance: Allow maximum 10.000 queries to us server per day
   + Platinum: No limit queries to server

- If possible, we can move us services to cloude (Google, Amazon,...), because their hardwards are very strong :)
